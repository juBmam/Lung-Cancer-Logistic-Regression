# Metis Project 3: Predicting Lung Cancer Risk Levels in Patients  
In this project, I used a kaggle dataset  and attempted to classify the target risk levels based on a large set of self-reported medical features, including but not limited to obesity, exposure to secondhand smoke, smoking, a balanced diet, age, gender, dust allergies, and more. I think that this data could help people self-diagnose risk levels and give them a good estimate of where they lie on the spectrum for cancer risk without having to pay for a trip to the docotrs and exposing themself to deadly diseases, such as COVID-19, given the current context.  
Tools used: SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLearn, Pickles, Flask, D3, among others.
